    contains N strongest, latest nodes we have received Topology from in the last day
    we only keep the shortest path to a node
    we might only keep paths to nodes we actually need to send to
    consider sending more packets if we see many different nodes
    consider forwarding a packet if we only have it in a non-direct route
      forward after random delay
      
    actual routing table with gateway per target node, only send via 1 node,
